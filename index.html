Currently Megan steers Fox Chapel's innovative and instructional initiatives. She is especially involved in identifying equitable opportunities for students to thrive while partnering with other districts and organizations for the betterment of all youth.  With a fantastic team of FCASD educators, Megan has rewritten the elementary computer science infusing digital citizenship, computational thinking, and robotics into grades K-6. She received a $60,000 grant from the Grable Foundation to infuse digital manufacturing via a Mobile Fab Lab into regional elementary schools, and is currently writing a new STEM curriculum for elementary.  This fall, the Fox Chapel Area School District was inducted into the prestigious League of Innovative Schools for the national leadership in the field of educational innovation.  Megan serves on the Carnegie Mellon University Create LAB Satellite Board, the Sprout Fund Board,  the Arts Educational Collaborative Advisor Board, and is the co-founder and board member of the Change Machine.  2015-2016 Honors: White House Maker Forum appointment, Open Portfolio Project appointment, IUP Doctoral Candidate; Digital Promise (Innovator Honorable Mention), Code.org (National Facilitator Communicator Award), and White House (Nominee Champion of Change for Making).</p>
